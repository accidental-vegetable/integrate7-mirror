# integrate7-mirror

This is a mirror of a Integrate7 script.
The original has been posted at:

Unfortunately, the original script, despite being `open-source` (author words),
does not seem to be in any git repository, and is released as a passworded archive and the old released versions are taken offline and are generally unavailable.

This makes it impossible to check for viruses without extracting archive and harder to follow script changes.

This repository will put each version in a separate branch, as many old versions unavailable from the source forum and the release timeline can't be recreated with versions I have.
